		<h3>Attorney Profile</h3>

		<article>
			<section>
				<p>I graduated with highest honors from the University of North Carolina School of Law in 2001. I was a member of the law review and my note won a national award. After law school, I clerked for Judge David M. Ebel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit.</p>
		 
		 		<p>Before starting my practice in 2009, I was an assistant federal defender in Philadelphia and an attorney for the national ACLU Capital Punishment Project. I also was an adjunct professor at UNC law school, where I taught habeas corpus procedure. </p>
