		<h3>Attorney Profile</h3>

		<section>
		<p>I graduated with highest honors from the University of North Carolina School of Law in 2001. I was a member of the law review and my note won a national award. After law school, I clerked for Judge David M. Ebel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit.</p>
	 
		<p>Before starting my practice in 2009, I was an assistant federal defender in Philadelphia and an attorney for the national ACLU Capital Punishment Project. I also was an adjunct professor at UNC law school, where I taught habeas corpus procedure. </p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<p>I'm a member of the Board of Governors of the Third Circuit Bar Association. I've been quoted as an authority on the Third Circuit by the New York Times and the Washington Post. I blog on the court at ThirdCircuitBlog.com.</p>

			<p>Here are some recent appeals I've worked on:
				<ul>
					<li>Reeves v. Coleman: application for COA asserting actual innocence</li>
					<li>Hoffman v. Nordic Naturals: petition seeking Third Circuit en banc rehearing</li>
	â€‹				<li>United States v. Ianieri: appellate brief asserting plain error -- Third Circuit reversed</li>
					<li>Teleguz v. Pearson: appellate brief challenging denial of habeas relief and asserting actual innocence -- Fourth Circuit reversed</li>
					<li>United States v. Parker: appellate brief challenging denial of 2255 relief -- Third Circuit reversed</li>
				</ul>
			</p>

			<p>I grew up in Montgomery County, Pennsylvania. I live with my wife and daughter in the Mt. Airy neighborhood of Philadelphia.</p>
